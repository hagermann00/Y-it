Not in the bullshit, introspective sense people throw around now, but in the jagged, too-honest way where I could see myself leaping from one deluded thought to the next like stones across a river I never wanted to cross. I wasn't blind to the illusions—I invited them in. I didn't believe every thought I had, but I gave them room. I let them unpack, settle, stay awhile—like a shitty roommate with a drinking problem. The kind everyone tiptoes around. I was too scared to call them out. Everyone was. No one ever did.</p>
