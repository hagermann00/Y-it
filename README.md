# Y-It Workflow Companion

This single-page helper keeps your workflow visible while you operate other web apps in neighbouring tabs. Think of it as a
living checklist that stores reusable prompts, notes, and status updates so you can run complex browser-based processes without
building any integrations.

## How it helps

- **Prompt library** – tap a preset card to instantly add a fully written step to your plan, then tweak it to match your
  situation.
- **Workflow planner** – arrange steps, set the app you will visit, capture notes, and keep everything aligned as you swap tabs.
- **Run mode** – select a step to focus on, copy the prompt into the target app, and mark your progress while the companion stays
  open in a second window.
- **Local saving** – your plan stays in the browser’s localStorage, so refreshing or closing the tab will keep the last plan ready
  for next time.

## Getting started

1. Open each tool you need (email, CRM, docs, etc.) in its own browser tab.
2. Keep `index.html` open in another tab or window. Split your screen if you prefer seeing both at once.
3. Click a preset prompt or add a blank step, then adapt the title, app, prompt, and notes.
4. When you are ready to execute, switch to the **Run mode** panel, pick the current step, and copy prompts into the other tabs as
   you work.
5. Use the status buttons to keep track of what is pending, active, or complete so teammates can resume without guesswork.

## Copying your plan

Use the “Copy plan summary” button to grab a plain-text version of every step. Paste it into documentation, a ticket, or chat to
hand off the workflow to someone else.
